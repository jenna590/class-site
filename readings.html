    <h3>A Rant on Technology by Ursula K. Le Guin</h3>
    <p>Ursula K. Le Guin questions our assumptions of what technology is and can be. She writes this essay in response to critics opinions that her science fiction stories are 'soft' because they don't involve what we normally think of as hi-tech. In response, she argues that technology is very present within her sf writing, but our perceptions of what technology is has become skewed due to the complex innovations that are present today. These make us forget the complexities of a simple tool like a fork and knife. Technology is practically anything humans use to aid us in some way. Classifying something as hi-tech feels as though the human is seperate from that thing, however the human has everything to do with it.</p>
    <h3>A Handmade Web by J.R. Carpenter</h3>
    <p>J.R. Carpenter emphasizes the artistic value of websites coded by hand rather than by software. She relates it to printed matter. Unlike printed matter however, the web is always in the making, never <em>finished</em>. Carpenter's writing is beautiful. Her description of dated web design from the 90's and its likeness to the peeling of old wallpaper paints a visual picture of peeking into the past. The TILDE.CLUB websites are a great example of the endless layers.</p>
    <h3>My Website is a Shifting House... by Laurel Schwulst</h3>
    <p>Laurel Schwulst describes the website in metaphors and expresses the presence of individualism on the web removed from social media corporations. Her metaphors reinforce the idea that a website can be anything in terms of its content or lack thereof. This relieves pressure off of the author(me) and clears up space for more fun and experimentation. Moving forward, I want to break my preconceived notion of what a website should be, and instead explore the freedom that being both the author and architect brings. </p>
